# MCMC-Project

This repository contains code used in my summer project undertaken during the second year of my bachelor's degree in Statistics at UCL, with funding provided by the EPSRC.

With the aim of improving my coding skills in python I wrote some tools to implement a few different sampling methods including Random-Walk Metropolis and Langevin Monte Carlo, as well as relevant diagnostic measures and plotting capability.
